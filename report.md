## Objective
The objective of this assignment is to introduce you to the use of pre-trained machine learning models in Azure and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). You will use cloud-based notebooks to interact with these models, focusing on speech and vision capabilities.

## Instructions

### 1. Work with Pre-trained Speech Models
- **GCP Speech-to-Text:**
  - Navigate to GCP and access the Vertex AI Notebooks.
  - Use a pre-configured notebook to interact with the GCP Speech-to-Text API.
  - Upload a sample audio file and transcribe it using the pre-trained speech model.
  - Document the results and the steps you took to achieve them.

### 2. Work with Pre-trained Vision Models
- **GCP Vision API:**
  - In the same or a new notebook, interact with the GCP Vision API.
  - Upload an image and use the Vision API to detect objects or text within the image.
  - Document the results and provide a brief analysis of the model's accuracy.
  
- **Azure AI Vision:**
  - Switch to Azure and access Azure Machine Learning (AML) Notebooks.
  - Use a pre-trained vision model in AML to perform a similar task as with GCP, such as object detection or text recognition.
  - Compare the results with those from GCP and document your findings.

### 3. Submit Your Work
- Create a Markdown document that includes:
  - Screenshots or outputs from the GCP Speech-to-Text and Vision API interactions.
  - Screenshots or outputs from the Azure AI Vision model interactions.
  - A comparison of the results from GCP and Azure, including reflections on model accuracy and ease of use.
  - Any challenges faced and how you resolved them.
